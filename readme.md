### Learn Mathematica

I've been struggling with Mathematica in PHYS 410, but it seems like a really cool tool, so I'm finally taking the time to gain basic fluency in it (while I should be studying for my 410 final). The [textbook I used](https://minerva.union.edu/labrakes/MathematicaIntro.pdf) is online, but I'm not sure who wrote it.
